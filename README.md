Authors: Emily Ahn, Divya Bilolikar, Ryan Peng, Niki Zamani

## Summary
Common heart diseases include disease of the blood vessel, arrhythmia (irregular beating of the heart), disease of the heart valve and muscle, infection of the heart, and heart defects from birth. The symptoms of heart diseases are often times unnoticeable and most are only diagnosed after a heart attack,heart failure, or stroke. In this project, we want to be able to predict if someone is at risk of a heart disease based on the variables given in the dataset.
